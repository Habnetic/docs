# Collaboration

## Purpose
Define how external collaborators can contribute without the project turning into a Slack channel with delusions of progress.

## Contribution pathways
- data ingestion improvements (sources + provenance + scripts)
- model components (fragility, downtime, cost)
- validation case studies (RTM/SFO/SYN)
- documentation and tutorials

## Expectations
- reproducible code (one-command principle)
- clear licensing and attribution for data
- issues and PRs preferred over private DMs

## Communication
- GitHub Issues for tasks and questions
- Pull Requests for changes
- short decision notes when assumptions change

## What to test next
Create 3 “good first issues” in resilient-housing-bayes:
1) RTM flood zones ingestion script
2) OSM buildings clipping to bbox
3) basic posterior predictive plotting template
