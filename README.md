# 🧠 Habnetic Documentation

Central documentation and research notes for the **Habnetic Open Research Lab**.

---

## 📚 Purpose
This repository serves as the written backbone of Habnetic — a structured archive of theory, methodology, and development notes that link architectural thinking with probabilistic modeling and open-source computation.

It replaces private note-taking tools with a transparent, version-controlled documentation system.
