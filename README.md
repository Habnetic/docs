# 🧠 Habnetic Documentation

Central documentation and research notes for the **Habnetic Open Research Lab**.

---

## 📚 Purpose
This repository serves as the written backbone of Habnetic — a structured archive of theory, methodology, and development notes that link architectural thinking with probabilistic modeling and open-source computation.

It replaces private note-taking tools with a transparent, version-controlled documentation system.

The guiding principles, scope, and intent of the project are defined in
[`vision/manifesto.md`](vision/manifesto.md).

## 🧭 How to read this repository

This documentation is intentionally **incremental**.

Many sections begin as conceptual scaffolding or placeholders and are expanded
only when they are actively used in models or decisions. This avoids freezing
assumptions too early and keeps documentation aligned with working code.

If a document appears minimal, it likely reflects an area that is still under
active exploration or has not yet been exercised by the modeling pipeline.

## ✍️ Conventions
- All text is written in Markdown (`.md`) for maximum compatibility.
- Use relative links between sections (e.g. `../projects/resilient_housing_bayes_summary.md`).
- Reference datasets by linking to the [Habnetic Data Repository](https://github.com/Habnetic/data).

This repository is **not** a step-by-step tutorial.  
Executable examples, models, and workflows live in the
[Resilient Housing Bayes](https://github.com/Habnetic/resilient-housing-bayes) repository.
