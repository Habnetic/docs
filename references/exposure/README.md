# Exposure Priors

This section defines deterministic exposure features used across
Habnetic models.

These documents define *what a variable means*.
They do not define models, code, or inference logic.

## Available priors

- **RTM — Water exposure (v0)**  
  `rtm_water_exposure_v0.md`  
  Distance-to-water and water-length density features derived from
  TOP50NL hydrography.
